Notes...
- You must type operation and key a space after colon
- You must type message on the 1st line of file
- Operations 1 && 2 require a range 1-25 to rotate becuase ranges 0 && 26 create no shift
- Operation 3 prints ALL possible decryptions (key with a range 0-25)
- Do NOT add a key value for operation 3
- Operations 4 && 5 require user to type alphabet in a different order, therefore 26 characters total
